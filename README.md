Cloud for distributed GPU farming

## Goals

* Leverage hard PoW based BCH contracts and fungible tokens to implement layer 1 on-chain solution
* Provisioning of compute via XLV spends
* Distributed GPU farming
* Automate uptime, and quality of inferencing from nodes to attribute emissions

## Functionality

## Research

* Additional paths to Anonymous Computation (FHE/TEE)
* COINSTAC (Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation) support
* Astronomical analysis and astrophysical processes simulation
