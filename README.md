# LIAISE
Cloud for distributed GPU farming

## Goals

* Leverage hard PoW based BCH contracts and fungible tokens to implement layer 1 on-chain solution
* Provisioning of compute via XLV spends
* Distributed GPU farming
* Automate uptime, and quality of inferencing from nodes to attribute emissions
* Certify a baseline of models, establish onboarding gates to broader set of HuggingFace models
  * High accuracy person detection ensemble consisting of facebook/detr-resnet-50, hustvl/yolos-tiny, frcnn-resnet, retinanet and ultralytics/yolov5
  * Automatic speach recognition with DeepFilterNet denoise and openai/whisper-large-v3
  * Generate 10 second video sequences
* Enable dynamic loading of external data
  * img2img diffusion
  * RAG (retrieval augmented generation) with custom embeddings to search knowledge base, PDF, etc.

## Research

* Additional paths to Anonymous Computation (FHE/TEE)
* COINSTAC (Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation) support
* Astronomical analysis and astrophysical processes simulation
