## Abstract 
Describes a distributed system for managing peer-to-peer ethical and rights
 protecting artificial intelligence spanning several key domains: integration with
 third-party blockchains for rewarding actors in the system; certification of adapters
 ranging from tiny client-side to large server-side models facilitating complex
 ensemble workflows; efficient sharing of system prompts, retrieval augmentation
 and training data sets with transparency and traceability; and orchestration of
 prompt, inference and central aggregation of tiny non-latency sensitive training
 workloads. Instead of proof-of-work style cryptographic hashes, the system relies
 upon a large number of end-users who are seeking rewards that initiate valuable
 proof-of-work for its security. Any actor with a supported blockchain public key
 address/account can interact directly with the LIAISE system without the need for
 any centralized entity or intermediary. The provisioning of LIAISE resources are
 instantaneous and permissionless. To navigate the complex challenges around
 operating an ethical artificial intelligence system, with humility we will be
 following the teachings of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. We have drawn
 inspiration and attempted aligning the design of the system to existing work done
 as part of Holy See sponsored initiatives.1
